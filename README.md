## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Community Creation:** Users can create their own sub-forums (communities) for topics they are interested in.
-   **Nested Post & Comment System:** A complete system for creating posts and threaded comments.
-   **Voting System:** Users can upvote and downvote posts and comments.
-   **Secure Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system powered by NextAuth.js (with Google Provider support).
-   **Infinite Scrolling:** Seamlessly load more content as the user scrolls for a smooth user experience.
-   **End-to-End Type Safety:** Guarantees data integrity from the database all the way to the user's screen.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project uses a **Decoupled Architecture**:

-   **Frontend (Next.js):** Handles all UI/UX rendering and client-side state management, leveraging the Next.js App Router and React Server Components (RSC) for maximum performance.
-   **Backend (Nest.js):** A robust Headless API Server responsible for all business logic, database interactions, and security.
-   **Database (PostgreSQL & Redis):** Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database for structured data and Redis for high-performance caching of frequently accessed data, like vote counts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
-   PNPM (recommended), NPM, or Yarn
-   Git
-   Docker (for running PostgreSQL and Redis databases) or a separate installation.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Thanabodee-Pond/agora-threads.git](https://github.com/Thanabodee-Pond/agora-threads.git)
    cd agora-threads
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and fill in all the required values:
    ```env
    # Database URL (for Prisma)
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

    # Redis (from Upstash or a local instance)
    REDIS_URL="redis://..."
    REDIS_SECRET="..."

    # NextAuth.js
    # Generate a secret using `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

    # Google OAuth Credentials (from Google Cloud Console)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Run Database Migration:**
    Use Prisma to generate database tables based on your schema.
    ```bash
    pnpm db:push # or npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    This will start both the frontend and backend development servers.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    -   The application will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

## üß™ Testing

This project prioritizes software quality through automated testing.

-   **Unit & Integration Tests:** We use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` to test logic and components.
-   **End-to-End Tests:** We use `Playwright` to simulate and validate real user flows.

**To run all tests:**
```bash
pnpm test
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Quality & Automation

We use a suite of tools to maintain high and consistent code quality:

-   **ESLint & Prettier:** For code linting and formatting.
-   **Husky & lint-staged:** To automatically lint and format code before each commit.
-   **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** Every pull request is automatically checked (Linting, Testing) to ensure code integrity before merging.
